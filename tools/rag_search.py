        **1. Core Concepts**

        DirXML Script is a structured language for defining identity management policies. The fundamental unit of policy execution is the **Policy** (`<policy>`). A `<policy>` operates on an XDS document, which is comprised of constituent **operations** (elements that are children of `<input>` or `<output>`).

        As a policy is applied to an operation, that operation becomes the **current operation**. The object described by the `src-dn`, `src-entry-id`, `dest-dn`, `dest-entry-id`, and/or `association` from the current operation becomes the **current object**.

        A `<policy>` consists of an ordered set of **Rules** (`<rule>`). Each `<rule>` defines a set of **Conditions** (`<conditions>`) to be tested and an ordered set of **Actions** (`<actions>`) to be performed when the conditions are met.

        Actions often require additional data or nested logic, which are provided by **Arguments** (`<arg-*>`). Most arguments, in turn, contain **Tokens** (`<token-*>`) which expand to dynamic values at runtime based on the rule evaluation context. The results of token expansion are concatenated to form the argument's value. This forms a hierarchical structure: **Policy -> Rule -> Conditions + Actions -> Arguments -> Tokens**.

        **2. Policy Structure (`<policy>`)**

        The `<policy>` element is the **top-level container** for defining the policy logic. Its primary purpose is to operate on an XDS document, examining and modifying it.

        *   **Allowed Content:**
            *   An optional `<description>` element.
            *   An ordered set of `<rule>` or `<include>` elements.
        *   **Parent Element:** None.
        *   **Basic Operation:** The policy is applied separately to each operation within the XDS document. Each rule within the policy is applied in order to the current operation, unless an action stops further processing.
        *   **Variables:** DirXML Script supports **global variables** (read-only, from Global Configuration Values defined for the driver or driver set) and **local variables** (set by a policy). Local variables can have either **policy scope** (visible only during the processing of the current operation by the setting policy) or **driver scope** (visible from all DirXML Script policies within the same driver until it stops). If a variable exists in both scopes, the policy-scoped variable takes precedence. Variable names must be legal XML Names.
            *   **Variable Expansion:** Many elements support dynamic variable expansion using the format `$$variable-name$$`. A literal `$` must be escaped with an additional `$` (e.g., `$$100.00`).
        *   **Date/Time Parameters:** Tokens dealing with dates/times support `format`, `language`, and `time zone` arguments. Formats starting with '!' are named formats; otherwise, they use `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` patterns. Language arguments conform to IETF RFC3066, and time zone arguments are identifiers recognizable by `java.util.TimeZone.getTimeZone()`.
        *   **XPATH Evaluation:** Arguments to some conditions and actions take an XPATH 1.0 expression. The context includes the current operation as the context node (unless specified otherwise), available variables (local policy > local driver > global GCVs precedence), explicitly and implicitly defined namespaces, built-in XPATH 1.0 functions, Java extension functions, and ECMAScript extension functions.
        *   **Include Element (`<include>`):** This element includes rules from another policy by referencing its DN. The DN can be relative to the including policy. Inclusion is recursive, but a policy cannot directly or indirectly include itself. It has no content.

        **3. Rule Structure (`<rule>`)**
